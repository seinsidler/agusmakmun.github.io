**Prerequisites:** Some high school math. A small amount of Calculus and notation often learned in Calculus will be used, but it can be skipped over without any loss of intuition to the ideas talked about. Knowing the rules of texas holdem would be more useful for this post than Calculus. 

## How About Some Math I Can Apply?
If you read my last post, there is a chance you walked away from it with the same feelings you had decades ago after math class, "How is counting the ways you can paint a cube at all useful or interesting to my life?" To be honest, thats a pretty fair point. The solution to the problem was, in my humble opinion, more interesting than the problem it solved. But the idea of groups isn't the most applicable mathemtical concept to everyday life. Today's post will prove to be vastly different in this regard.

I won't be tackling a specific problem today, but discussing and showing examples of one of my favorite topics in applied mathematics: expected value. When people question how mathematics can be applied to their own lives, I see no better topic than expected value. In fact, I'd argue understanding expected value can only increase you quality of life. More on this claim to come!

## So, What is Expected Value Anyway? 
Initially, I planned on trying to use our intuition to arrive at the mathematical defintion of expected value, but I found that it will be easier to give the definition with all it's mathematical terms and aid it immediately with an example. 

**Expected value**, which I'll label $E(X)$, is the weighted average of all possibiles values of a random variable $X$. For discrete random variables, this can be written as 
$$\mathrm{E}(X)=x_1p_1+x_2p_2+...+x_np_n=\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i p_i$$
where the $x$'s are the possible outcomes of the random variable $X$ and the $p$'s are the probability of each outcome.

Okay, I used some fancy math notation and introduced some things that aren't clearly defined, like *random variable*. But instead of giving further explanation to this, I'm going to apply this definition to a simple problem, and most of the confusion up until this point will subside.

### Let's Roll a Die
What is the expected value of a dice roll? In other words, what is the average value of rolling a die? Let's assume that we have a fair die, where each side is as likely to appear as any other side. 

Our goal is to figure out what the $x$'s are and what the $p$'s are, and then we can plug this in to find the expected value of a roll of dice. 

Before we dive right into that, let me introduce the concept of a **random variable**. What's annoying about the term "random variable" is that a random variable is actually a function that maps the possible events to a number. In the case of our dice roll, our random variable is the value of the die on a dice roll. 

This means that the $x$'s are all the possible rolls of a die, which are just the numbers 1 through 6. 

For the $p$'s, we need to know the probability of each outcome. Because each side is equally as likely to be rolled, all the $p$'s are the same probability, specifically $p=\frac{1}{6}$. Now, we can plug in for the $x$'s and the $p$'s to get the expected value, which is
$$E(X)=1\cdot\frac{1}{6}+2\cdot\frac{1}{6}+3\cdot\frac{1}{6}+4\cdot\frac{1}{6}5\cdot\frac{1}{6}+6\cdot\frac{1}{6}=3.5$$
Obviously, you can't roll a $3.5$ on a normal die. It's best to think of expected value as a weighted average, where the weights of each value is the probability of that value occuring. What this means is that if we roll a bunch of times (like A LOT of times), we anticipate the average number of the dice roll is 3.5. 

What's powerful about this is that we can find some kind of meaning through randomness. We can apply this concept to help inform out decision making. 

## How to Win at Poker 
Okay, I've clickbaited here a little bit. I don't have the secret formula for how to win at poker and make millions of dollars. If I do come across this, I'll make sure to post it on the best website in the world, scotteinsidler.com. 

What I can say is that expected value can be applied to poker to help us learn how to play poker.

**Note:** Just a disclaimer, I'm going to talk specifically about Texas hold'em. 

### Why Other Casino Games Suck
Poker is a game you find at a casino, but its not like the majority of games at a casino. Most other casino games involve two parties: the casino goers and the casino. When we play these games, we make bets on certain outcomes of spinning a wheel, or rolling a die, or comparing sets of cards. If you win, the casino matches your bet and you win what you initially bet, and if you lose, you lose your bet. Let's say that the amount you can win or lose is $X$ , which is a random variable that we can measure in dollars. Then, we can say that 
$$ E(X)= \textit{Expected value of the amount we win or lose}$$
If we a place a bet that is $ \$x $, for most games we can assume that we either win $x$ dollars or lose $x$ dollars (losing $x$ dollars is, of course, the same as winning $-x$ dollars). With this, we can roughly write out some kind of expected value for a game where we either win or lose a bet against the house as 
$$ E(X)=p\cdot x-q\cdot x$$
where $p$ is the probability of winning and $q$ is the probability of losing. 
For example, if you went to *Scott's Fair & Fun Casino* and played a game where you bet on fair coin tosses, where you have $1/2$ chance of winning or losing, $p=q=\frac{1}{2}$. This menas that the expected value of the coin toss game is 
$$ E(X)=\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{2}x=0$$
A game where the $E(X)=$ is a fair game. However, most casino games aren't so fair. Casino games are designed for the odds to be ever so slightly in favor of the casino. Even if every bet is equally matched, the casino games are designed such that $q>p$, so $E(X) < 0$. This means that *you lose money* on average, the more you play!

### Poker Is Different, I Swear!
In poker, the expected value is slightly more complicated. Firstly, you are usually playing more than just one person. But more importantly, all the rules of poker apply equally to all players. And all the money on the table can be won by any of the players. 

If everything is equal for all players, does that mean that poker is just like the coin toss game at the most generous casino in the world, *Scott's Fair & Fun Casino* and have an expected value of zero? Not really. The decisions you make playing poker - folding, beting, checking, raising, and calling - all have different outcomes in the long run. And you are up against opponents who are all trying to make the best decisions given the cards on the board and the two cards in their hand. 

I could go into detail of the game theory of poker and how expected value is calculated in Texas holdem theoretically and in practice, but that could be its own series of posts (which I might do eventually). What's important to realize is that if you make better decisions than your opponents, we would imagine that $E(X) > 0$ for you and if you make worse decisions than your opponents, we would imagine that $E(X) < 0$ (Here, our random variable $X$ will just represent the amount we win or lose given our actions playing. We won't be rigorously calculating $E(X)$ so just think about it is the expected value of what we win over the course of our poker career). 

Now, remember that $E(X)$ here *is not* how much money we actually have won or lost playing poker. In fact, if $E(X) > 0$, you still could have lost money in the totality of your poker career. This is really what it means to be unlucky or lucky in poker. We intuitively know this when a player goes all in and bets their whole stack of chips, a player calls his bet with a losing hand, and the last card comes out to make the losing hand now a winning hand. The player who went all in may have made the decision that on average would have won him money, but in this particular case, lost him a lot of money. 

All of this means that it is possible to be a winning player in poker, and the way you go about this is to maximize your expected value of winnings, or at least have expected value of winnings be positive.

### How Do Poker Players Use Expected Value?


Poker players today now have access to poker solvers that can calculate the *game theory optimal* (GTO) strategy, or at least an extremely good approximation of it. GTO strategy means that every decision you make maximizes your expected profit. While it is impossible for humans to play GTO poker, due to the immense game state and assumptions players have to make about other players, a studious poker player can use a solver to make sure they are making decisions that optimize their profit they make over time. 

Let's take a look at an example with a solver to see how expected value comes into play!

Below is a screenshot of a poker solver for a particular hand. Poker solvers usually are for situations where it is two players against each other, so we have player 1 and player 2 as different players in our solvers. At the top, we have the game decision tree. This shows the actions taken along with the current possible decisions and when new cards appear on the board. For poker solvers to be able to solve a situation, we have to set certain bet sizes. This helps to make the game tree a reasonable size. Otherwise, we would have to wait lifetimes before we could study a hand! 

<img src="/pictures/overview_of_a_solver.png">

We are also given a table of all the hands, sorted by highest to lowest equity (lets not get into that concept now, for another post), along with "EV", or our good ole friend, expected value! 

It's also important to note that the solver is used for all the betting after we see the first three cards. On the left, we can see that the board, which is the king of hearts, ten of hearts, and eight of spades. Allow me to abberviate this as KhTh8s, where the "h" represents "hearts" and the s is "spades" ("d" is for "diamonds" and "c" is clubs of course). 

The last important thing to note, the big grid in the middle shows all the hands you would be left with (that you haven't folded at some point according the the solver), and they are colored by the actions you should most likely take. 

One way I study with solvers is to take particular spots I encounter and review whether the decisions I made cost me expected value. For example, lets say I'm player one and I have Qc8c in my hand and we play out the hand according to the image of the solver above. In other words, KhTh8s6s5c is on the board and it is my turn to bet. Here, we are restricting ourselves to three possible decisions: a huge all-in bet, a small bet, or check. It's also good to note that the currently has $90 in it in this scenario and we have $449 in our own stack of chips.  

If we look at the row of the table for Qc8c, we get what's shown below.

<img src="/pictures/qc8c.png">

We can see that our EV (or expected value) overall for our hand is $26.81. Considering the pot being $90, this doesn't look too good for our hand, but it certainly could be worse. We have a pair of eights, which is beat by a lot, but can beat some hands that are worthless. 

The colorful numbers next to expected value are the expected value of each decision; the dark blue number is the expected value of a big bet, the pink number is the expected value of a small bet, and the green number is the expected value of a check. As we can see, making a big bet has a negative expected value of $-53.07. It would be a terrible decision to go all in with eights here!

But should we bet at all? Even a little bit? The expected value of a small bet is $25.31 while just checking has an expected value $26.81. While this is a small difference, over time, these decisions compound. That's why the solver decision is purely check here and never betting, and the expected value of Qc8c at this point in the hand is the same as checking. 

That's enough about poker! We could see how expected value is useful for poker, but lets see how it applies on the diamond.


## How to Win at Baseball
One of my favorite books of all time (the movie is pretty good too), *Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game* by Michael Lewis, documents the start of the data revolution in baseball. More specficially, Michael Lewis follows general manager Billy Beane of the Oakland A's during the 2002 season. Billy Beane and the Oakland A's were trying to do something no other baseball team truly attempted: use a data drive approach to try to win baseball games. 

I highly recommend reading the book for yourself. Especially if you appreciate sports or data science. 

Some of the conclusions that Billy Beane and the management of the A's 
came to are widely accepted today, though certainly weren't twenty years ago. For example, they found that how often you get on base, or your on-base percentage, was way more important than how much you hit the ball, or your batting average.

But central to all of there findings was the use of expected value to determine what actions lead to more runs and which players lead to more runs than their salary let on. 

### Using Expected Value In Baseball
Utimately, if you are a professional baseball team, you want to do everything you can to maximize the amount of points you get during a season. While you can't control how your opponents play, you as a team have the ability to put yourself in the best position to win. In other words, you want to maximize the expected number of runs during a season, and if possible, minimize the number of expected runs against you. 

In fact, baseball statisticians have gone through all the available play by play data to come up with a simple matrix that captures the expected value of all the possible configurations of runners on base and the number of outs called the **run expectancy matrix*. What this matrix tells us, specifically is how many runs are expected to be scored from this point up until the end of the inning. Below is the *run expectancy matrix* that I found from [here](https://library.fangraphs.com/misc/re24/). 

<img src="/pictures/re24.png">

Here, each row is a different configuration of runners. For example, "1_ _" is a runner on first and " _ 2 _" means there is a runner on second, etc. What we can do is take the difference of two game states to determine whether an action won our team or lost our team expected runs.

For example, suppose there is one out, and we have runners on first and second. When we step up to the plate, our team's expected runs is 0.908 runs according to the matrix. If I ground out so that there are two outs and runners on first and second still, our expected runs shoots down to 0.343. This means that the expected runs of the ground out is 
$$ 0.343-0.908=-0.565 $$
expected runs. Not Good!

However, if instead, we hit a single so that the bases are loaded, our expected value now shoots up to 1.520, making the expected runs for the single 
$$ 1.520-0.908=0.612 $$

There are many other uses for expected value in baseball, and the A's utilized expected value for evaluating the value of players along with how to play the game itself. But enough about baseball already!

## How to Win At Life
Okay, this is the last clickbait in this post, I promise. But expected value can at least help you fight off your human instincts when these instincts cause you to make decisions antithetical to your goals!

### Take More Risks, My Friends!
[Veritasium made a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX-KulgJ1o) asking people on the street if they would take a bet that is identical the bet I posed earlier made by *Scott's Fair & Fun Casino*. He asked people to bet on a coin flip, and if they win, they get $10 (I think it was some other currency that I couldn't recognize, but the specific currency is pretty irrelevant to the point) and if they lose, they lose $10. As we discussed before, and as Veritasium discusses, this is a fair bet. That means you would be break even taking this bet. No one took the bet.

He then asked people, if instead of winning $10, you win $15 instead. Still, no one took it.

With our knowledge of expected value, we an see that the expected value of this bet for us, assuming a fair coin, is 
$$ \frac{1}{2}\cdot \$15 -\frac{1}{2}\cdot \$10=\$2.50$$
so we should take this bet because we expect to win $2.50 on average. 

He kept increasing the winnings, but people still refused. The feeling of losing money was more present in their minds than the chance of winning money. This is part of our own psychology. But with our knowledge of expected value, we can find when risks are worth taking!

### Let's Get Philsophical
I'll admit, what is to come is my opinion. I'm not a philosopher. But I do believe that we all have our own values, and everyone can construct their own value functions of how much they value certain outcomes over others. This could be choosing a job to work, picking plans for the evening, or any other decision we have put in front of us. If we have an idea as to how likely things are to occur, and the value they give us, we can construct the expected value of every decision we make. And our goal in life, is to maxmize the expected value of our decisions according to our own value functions.

What is your value function? Does it change over time? Honestly, I'm not sure. But applying the principal of expected value to helps you better understand how to properly weight decisions. Yes, maybe trying to apply to that job you want is almost pointless because you don't think you have good chances. But is the pay off of getting the job valuable enough to you that you might as well try?

## Conclusion
I said more than I wanted to about expected value, but I hope I've shown how useful of an idea it is in several contexts. This post is also making me realize that I should write some more posts in the future on the mathematics involved in poker. If that's something people want, I'll do that sooner rather than later. 

I also hope it's clear that I don't expect you to be able to calculate expected value of various random variables from this post, but rather show how a concept as powerful as expected value can be applied to many different scenarios, and can be applied to your own lives. I might revist this topic again to give it more justice in the future, but for now, go off and buy some lottery tickets if the probabilities are right!

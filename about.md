For those that would like to know, I'm a software and ML engineer who studied Applied Mathematics for my undergraduate degree at Tufts University. Currently, I'm studying to receive a Master's Degree online in Applied and Computational Mathematics through the Johns Hopkins Whiting School for Engineering Professionals. 

I have both personal and professional experience in a wide area of fields in both mathematics and computer science: machine learning, cryptocurrency, software development, network engineering, embedded systems, just to name a few. To me, I am more gravitated towards the problems that are trying to be solved than the areas of interest that these problems reside in. Mathematics, especially in an applied setting, should be seen as a thorough tool kit to attack a wide array of problems. Sticking to one domain or area of study is probably a better strategy for one's career. However, the experience I can about is the endeavor to understand more about the world around us and the problems we (the big "all of humanity" we) want to solve. 

If I have to pride myself in anything, its my ability to learn new things and understand new concepts. My math education has given me the mathematical literacy to be able to digest academic papers and to try and replicate them on my own. My experience working at small companies has shown me what it takes to accomplish tasks and to actually make headway on difficult projects.
